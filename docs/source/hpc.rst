Project - Cloudmesh HPC Experiments
--------------------------

Cloudmesh contains an HPC experiment framework, that allows users to
run experiments on remote super computers. This project is extending
this framework while

1. providing mechanisms for dealing with arbitrary batch scripts
2. providing mechanisms for dealing with input and output data
3. making experimentsrepeatable
4. providing a django based user interface for experiment
   management

This project will use comet from SDSC and juliet from IU
