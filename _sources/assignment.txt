Assignment - Ansible
=====================

1. Develop ansible scripts to deploy 
2. Demonstrate use of the ansible scripts by
   
   1. create a reproducable deployment
   2. have a usecase demonstrate that the deployment works
   3. contribute the ansible script and the demnstration


Grading
--------

We have identified the following projects with various degree of difficulty. Pick several of them so you can earn 5 stars. Grading of the project is simple

* 5 stars all perfectly done = A
* 4 stars all perfectly done = B
* 3 stars all perfectly done = C
* 2 stars all perfectly done = D
* 1 stars all perfectly done = D-

(a) One of the projects must be 3 stars or you must have 2 two star projects.

6 or more points will add bonus, but ponus only applies if condition (a) has been perfectly solved.

Point deduction for security violations
----------------------------------------

20% Point deduction will be given if a password or username of yours is checked into github. Remember you do not want your usernames and passwords leak to the outside world.

* Q: Where should you not store a username or password?
* Q: What should you do if you did?
* Q: Whay can I not hide that i exosed my username or password?
* Q: WHo do you not expose your username and passwords?

In addition to this deduction, your account may be blocked for several days till we have
identified and worked with you on eliminating the security threat. Please be careful.
